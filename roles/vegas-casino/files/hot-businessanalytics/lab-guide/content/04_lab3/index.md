## Lab 3: getting value from automation

In this hands-on, we’ll be setting up this process using some existing building blocks! You will have access to your own **Mattermost channel**, so you will be able to monitor that your messages are being sent correctly.

### 3.1 Choosing when your Workflow will run
1. Using the “**App drawer**” in the top-left of the screen (or the search) – *find* the **“Workflow”** app and *open* it.
1. *Choose* “**+ Workflow**” in the top-right and you should see the view shown on the screen.
1. The first thing to do is *choose* **when this Workflow will run** – for the purpose of this exercise we will *choose* the “**On demand**” trigger at the bottom, so it will *only* be executed when you hit **“Run"**.

### 3.2 Querying the failed Order IDs
Now that we’ve set when this will run, we can start to add in the rest of the logic!

1. *Click* the purple “**+**” icon underneath your trigger and you’ll be presented with the options you see on the screen to add new logical “**tasks.**”
1. First **“task”** will be to get the **Company** and **StepNames** with issues – so we’ll *choose* the “Execute DQL Query” action which is going to look through the data for these Exceptions within the last 24 hours.
1. The DQL query itself will look through the data for the “**Exception**” events that get created – it will then return the contextual information that let’s us take some action, for example the **errorType** and **errorMessage** 

```
fetch bizevents, from:now()-24h
| filter matchesPhrase(event.type, "Exception")
| fields json.companyName, json.stepName, json.correlationId, json.errorType, json.errorMessage
```

### 3.3 Formatting the data to send

Our previous step will return the **“raw” data** of the Exceptions that we are facing, but because we want to send this in a **Mattermost channel** – we’ll apply some formatting to make it look nice!

1. Use the purple “**+**” again to *add* another “**task**” and this time *choose* “**Run Javascript**.”
1. *Copy* over the **JavaScript** from the lab guide into the “**input**” section that’s opened up on the **right-hand side**. 

```JavaScript
// optional import of sdk modules 
import { execution } from '@dynatrace-sdk/automation-utils'; 

export default async function ({ execution_id }) { 
  const yourName = "HAL9000";
  const dqlStepName = "execute_dql_query_1"; 

  // Fetch DQL result
  const r = await fetch(`/platform/automation/v1/executions/${execution_id}/tasks/${dqlStepName}/result`); 
  const body = await r.json(); 
  const events = body["records"]; 

  // Build Mattermost message
  let niceOutput = `:rotating_light: **[${yourName}] Exception Events Detected (Last 24h)** :rotating_light:\n`;

  events.forEach((event, index) => {
    niceOutput += `\n---\n:hash: **Event #${index + 1}**\n`
                + `&#127970; **Company**: \`${event['json.companyName']}\`\n`
                + `:gear: **Step**: \`${event['json.stepName']}\`\n`
                + `:link: **Correlation ID**: \`${event['json.correlationId']}\`\n`
                + `:boom: **Error Type**: \`${event['json.errorType']}\`\n`
                + `:speech_balloon: **Message**: _${event['json.errorMessage']}_\n`;
  });

  return niceOutput;
}
```

3. Near the top is a section titled “**Enter your details here!**” which has 2 values.
     - Enter “**your name**”. (either your actual name or something slightly humorous) *This will be used at the start of the message we send to Mattermost – in a real scenario, this could be a point of contact should anyone have questions about the message.*
     - *Enter* name of the “**task**” (or step) of the DQL we just added.  *If you didn’t change the name of that step leave it as-is, otherwise change it to the name that you have used.*

At a high-level what this **code** is *doing* is firstly *getting* the **results** of the **DQL** from the previous step, then creating a **nicely formatted message for Mattermost** where each Order is listed out on a new line (and includes emojis!).

### 3.4 Sending the orders to a Mattermost channel

The last step now is to *send* the **message** we’ve just created into the Mattermost channel. To make this possible we first need to create a “**URL**” that we can *send* the **messages** to via **API**.

1. Open up the **ACE-box dashboard** and *select* the “**Links**” tab – there is a “**Mattermost**” row here and this will give you the URL and **credentials** to be able to *login*.
2. Once you’ve logged in, *click* the **icon** with four square in the **top-left** of the interface and choose **Integrations** > **Incoming Webhooks**. 
3. *Choose* to “**Add Incoming Webhook**” a new webhook, and *give* it a **title** 
4. *Set* the channel to “**Town Square**”
5. *Hit* “**Save**,” and make a *copy* of the **URL** that it provides.
6. In Dynatrace, head to the "**Settings Classic**" app and navigate to "**Preferences**" > "**Limit outbound connections.**"
7. Choose the option to "**Add item**" and add in the "**domain**" part of the URL from Mattermost.
8. - The end value should only have "mattermost.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.dynatrace.training"
8. Back in your Workflow, *Click* the purple “**+**” to add a new “**task**”
9. *Choose* the “**HTTP Request**" task
10. *Change* the request type to "**POST**"
11. For the "**URL**" box enter the URL that was just generated in Mattermost.
12. For the **payload** of the request, *enter* the **value below** so that it will send in the message we created in the JavaScript step:

```
{
  "text": "{{result("run_javascript_1") }}"
}
```
13. "**Deploy**" your progress at the top of the screen.
14. *Hit* the "**Save and Deploy**" Button in the Pop-Up.
15. Under “**Settings**” at the top, *enable* “**Workflow admin**.”

### 4.5 Run the Workflow
1. *Hit* the “**Run**” button at the top of the screen
2. *Hit* the “**Allow & Run**” button in the Pop-Up and your Workflow should run successfully! If you get an Exception while running the Workflow for the first time simply try to re-run it another time and this time it should finish successfully.
3. Keep an eye on the **Mattermost channel** for the “**name**” that you entered in the JavaScript step which will indicate that your message was properly received.
